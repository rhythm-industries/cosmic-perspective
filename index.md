# Cosmic Perspective

These are my working notes on the cosmic perspective — an attempt to read the signs of the universe through science, story, and contemplation.

Contained within is a human-scale timeline of the universe:

- [The Cosmic Timeline](cosmic-timeline) – 13.8 billion years compressed into a single calendar year so we can better understand:
  where we come from, where we are, and how brief “now” really is.

Also included:

- [Sources](sources) – All sources cited in the cosmic timeline
- [Ways of Knowing](ways-of-knowing) – A primer proof, experience, and meaning.

This is not a belief system.  
It is a lens.

**Accordingly**, this project is built with plain text and open tools. Nothing here depends on a particular platform or service. You are free to host a copy anywhere, adapt it to your own purposes, or keep it private.

Fork it.  
Adapt it.  
Translate it.  
Make it your own. 

If it helps even one person feel more oriented in the universe, it has done its job.
