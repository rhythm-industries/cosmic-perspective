# Ways of Knowing

Here is a brief primer on proof, experience, and meaning.

<!--

Provability:  What can be demonstrated within a method  
Truth: What may be real, meaningful, or consequential  

Science maximizes **provability**.
Religion, philosophy, and contemplation often aim at **truth** in a broader sense.

Gödel formalized the gap.
*Contact* dramatized it.
The Qur’an assumes it.
